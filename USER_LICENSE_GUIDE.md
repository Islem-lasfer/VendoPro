# 📖 USER GUIDE - How to Activate Your License

## ✅ Simple 4-Step Process

### Step 1: Receive Your License File

You will receive a file from your vendor that looks like this:
```
license-ABC12-DEF34-GHI56-JKL78-MNO90.lic
```

**Save this file** somewhere you can find it (Desktop, Downloads, etc.)

---

### Step 2: Launch the POS Application

1. Double-click the POS application icon
2. You will see the license activation screen: (a code labeled "Disk ID" is shown — copy it and "Send to deployer" so your vendor can generate a .lic bound to your machine). You can also enter your name, email and phone and click "Send to deployer" to send these details to pos.sales.system@gmail.com (automatic when online). If you are offline, the app shows vendor contact info: pos.sales.system@gmail.com and +213 782073213 so you can contact them manually.
