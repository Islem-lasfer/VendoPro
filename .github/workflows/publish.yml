        run: npx electron-builder --mac --publish always

# Notes:
# - This workflow triggers on a tag like v1.2.3 (push annotated tag).
# - electron-builder reads GH_TOKEN to publish to Releases.
# - macOS builds that are signed/notarized require Apple credentials; Windows code signing requires a certificate and env vars.
# - Consider using a separate job to create the release and then upload artifacts from each runner, or use GH_TOKEN published by electron-builder as above.
